BoxOffice Gross Excercise

BoxOffice Gross Excercise

BoxOffice Mojo has the Total Gross Earning of 735 movies for 2016 (http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=2016&p=.htm). The task for today is to scrape the dataset of 735 movies, and predict the top 15 movies (in-terms of gross earnings) of a random of movies.

The test data set should be a holdout of 2016 movies itself. Variables used for this prediction must include the following:

number of theatres/screens
the release month of the movie
Genre (Action, comedy etc)
Studio (Fox, Warner Bros. etc)
Runtime (minutes)
These can be captured from BoxOffice mojo or with the IMDd Python library.

Results should be presented in an Ipython notebook with a written analysis of the regression and validation results and an overall analysis of this model.
